## QT

**what do i like about QT** <br>
    - A Big advantage of qt in my opinion is that is is written in and based aroutn cpp. One of the best languages for OOp programming so you can implement oop into your aaplication
    - Also i like that you can draw your own stuff without special animations like css. This opens a new world for applications
**what do i dislike about QT** <br>
    - The styling of the UI is unatural and difficult. 
    - The basic styling is also really ugly.
    - For me QT has a big learning curve so that is also a big problem
